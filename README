babynewt is forum software.

The basic functionality is that of a single thread with categorized posts.
Users can make their own templates (including stylesheets) and share them with
other users.

Initial development was by Rob Drimmie. Significant contributions (especially
for templating and searching) were made by Clayton Hannah.

Most of the code was written in 2001 and is terrible. Adding it to github is
the first step in a concerted effort to clean the code up and make it useful.
